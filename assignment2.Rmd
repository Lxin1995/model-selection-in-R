This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

1. Part 1



```{r}
d5 = read.csv(file ='/Users/liuxin/Documents/graduate/297B/dat-20160413.csv', header = T)
```

```{r}
plot(d5)
```

```{r}
install.packages('HoRM')
require(HoRM)
regressogram(x = d5$xx, y = d5$yy, nbins = 6, x.lab = "xx",
             y.lab = "yy", main = "Regressogram")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
